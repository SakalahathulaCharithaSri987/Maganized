🌟 Grateful Moment Unlocked 🎨✨

"Art enables us to find ourselves and lose ourselves at the same time." – Thomas Merton  **

I'm incredibly happy to share that I’ve been featured as a Mandala Artist in my college magazine! 🖊️📖

What started as a small hobby turned into a beautiful journey of creativity, mindfulness, and self-expression. Mandala art has taught me patience, focus, and the beauty of balance.

Along with being passionate about art, I’ve always believed in maintaining academic excellence — and I’m grateful to be recognized for both my artworks and studies. 💫
Being acknowledged by my college in this way is truly an honor I’ll always cherish.
Thanks for checking out my creative side!🌀✨
Thank you to everyone who supported me on this path.
